# travelApp

This app was built with the latest version of Angular 6 CLI. 

Using reactive form features, this app allows a user to add, edit, update, and delete a 'trip', a destination where one might want to go while keeping track of the associated costs.

This app also consumes the Unsplash API to allow the user to find free, high-res photos to use as their trips profile pic.
